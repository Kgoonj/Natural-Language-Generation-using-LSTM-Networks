# 🧠 LSTM Text Modeling with Keras

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`LSTM_Text.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for text-based tasks using TensorFlow/Keras.

Whether you're generating text, doing sentiment analysis, or learning how LSTM networks work, this project is a great starting point for diving into deep learning with sequence data.

## 📌 Project Overview

The notebook walks through:

- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Preparing sequence data for training
- Building an LSTM model using Keras
- Training the model on sample text data
- Generating predictions or text output

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this notebook locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LSTM_Text.git
cd LSTM_Text
2. Install dependencies
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
Optional: Install Jupyter if you don't already have it

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install notebook
3. Launch the notebook
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook LSTM_Text.ipynb
📈 Model Architecture
The model typically consists of:

Embedding layer

One or more LSTM layers

Dense output layer

It is trained on sequences of tokenized text to either predict the next word or classify text.

📊 Results
The model outputs either:

Predicted next word(s) or text sequence (in generation tasks)

Classification probabilities (in text classification tasks)
